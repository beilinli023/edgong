    "content_en": "<p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to attend a 16-day global camp at Epsom College in the UK. It was a perfect blend of learning, adventure, and cultural exploration.</p><p>During the day, we had ESL classes, which were both challenging and fun. The teachers were amazing—friendly, patient, and always encouraging us to raise our hands and share our ideas.</p><p>After classes, we enjoyed a mix of indoor games and outdoor activities. The outdoor activities were my favorite because we got to play different sports as a team. Basketball was definitely the highlight!</p><p>The evenings were just as exciting. On the first night, we had a movie night, and they screened Mission: Impossible. It was so much fun watching it with my new friends from all over the world.</p><p>One of the best parts of the camp was the excursion trips. We visited museums where I saw fascinating artifacts from ancient Egypt, Rome, and China. I took so many pictures—it felt like I was traveling through time!</p><p>The most inspiring trip was to Oxford University. Walking through the historic campus, surrounded by academics and students, was a dream come true.</p><p>Looking back, this summer camp was more than just a language program—it was a journey of growth, friendship, and discovery. I improved my English, made lifelong friends, and gained a deeper understanding of the world.</p>",
