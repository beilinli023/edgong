    "content_en": "Last year, I participated in a two-week language exchange program at Ritsumeikan University in Japan. The program was structured with morning classes from 9 AM to 12 PM. The teachers at Ritsumeikan University were incredibly patient and supportive. Even though I struggled with pronouncing Japanese words at times, they were always encouraging and made the learning process enjoyable. Their dedication helped me gain confidence in speaking Japanese, and I’m so grateful for their guidance. I miss them so much!\n\nOne of the highlights of the program was the cultural activities. Each week, we had two cultural experiences on weekdays, and they were absolutely fascinating. The first activity was watching a Maiko and Geiko performance. I was completely amazed by their grace and skill. What shocked me the most was learning about the years of rigorous training they undergo. During their training, they aren’t allowed to use phones or go home, and their traditional clothing is incredibly intricate and special.\n\nThe second activity was Japanese drumming (Taiko). We got to try beating the drums ourselves, and it was such a fun and energetic experience. After morning classes, I would have lunch with my classmates at the school canteen. The meals were not only affordable but also delicious! My absolute favorite was chirashi don—a bowl of sushi rice topped with fresh sashimi and a perfectly cooked onsen egg on the side.\n\nWith weekends off, I had the chance to explore Kyoto, a city rich in history and culture. From visiting stunning temples like Kinkaku-ji to strolling through the iconic Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, every moment felt like a new adventure. Kyoto’s blend of tradition and modernity left me in awe, and I’m so glad I got to experience it.\n\nLooking back, this language exchange program was more than just learning Japanese—it was a journey of personal growth, cultural understanding, and making lifelong memories. I improved my language skills, immersed myself in Japanese traditions, and met amazing people from all over the world. Until next time, じゃあね!",
    "content_zh": "去年，我参加了日本立命馆大学为期两周的语言交流项目。项目安排是每天早上9点到12点的课程。立命馆大学的老师们非常耐心和支持。尽管我在发音上有时会遇到困难，但他们总是鼓励我，让学习过程变得愉快。他们的帮助让我在日语口语上更加自信，我真的很感激他们的指导。我非常想念他们！\n\n项目的亮点之一是文化活动。每周我们会在工作日参加两次文化体验，这些活动非常有趣。第一次活动是观看舞伎和艺伎的表演。她们的优雅和技艺让我惊叹不已。最让我震惊的是了解到她们需要经历多年的严格训练。在训练期间，她们不能使用手机或回家，而且她们的服装非常复杂和特别。\n\n第二次活动是日本太鼓。我们亲自尝试了打鼓，这是一次充满乐趣和活力的体验。早上课程结束后，我会和同学们在学校食堂一起吃午餐。食堂的饭菜不仅价格实惠，而且非常美味！我最喜欢的是散寿司饭——一碗寿司米饭，上面铺满新鲜的刺身，旁边还有一个完美的温泉蛋。\n\n周末休息时，我有机会探索京都这座充满历史和文化的城市。从参观金阁寺这样的美丽寺庙，到漫步在标志性的岚山竹林，每一刻都像是一次新的冒险。京都传统与现代的结合让我感到震撼，我很高兴能体验到这一切。\n\n回顾这段经历，这次语言交流项目不仅仅是学习日语——它是一次个人成长、文化理解和创造终身回忆的旅程。我提高了语言能力，深入了解了日本传统，并结识了来自世界各地的朋友。下次见，じゃあね！（See you later!）",
